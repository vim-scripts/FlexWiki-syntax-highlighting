Summary: Using Vim to edit FlexWiki pages

!Vim Plugin For FlexWiki
The "FlexWiki":http://www.georgevreilly.com/vim/flexwiki/ plugin makes editing @.wiki@ files much easier with "Vim":http://www.vim.org (Vi ""IMproved""). The plugin provides syntax highlighting; the default textbox provided by FlexWiki has all the charm and power of Notepad. The plugin also sets a number of buffer-local options which make editing very long lines much more pleasant.

The plugin was written by GeorgeReilly.

!!Installation
	* Obtain the "FlexWiki plugin for Vim":http://www.georgevreilly.com/vim/flexwiki/
	* Install "Vim":http://www.vim.org
	* Set the _HOME_ environment variable to point to somewhere sensible.
	* Create a new folder, @_HOME_\vimfiles@
	* Unzip flexwiki.zip in that folder.
	* Restart Vim.

!!Using the plugin
	* Either, edit a FlexWiki page directly, if you have access to the wiki's filestore, using @:e ThatPage.wiki@
	* Or, @:new SomePage.wiki@ to create a new FlexWiki buffer, then copy-and-paste the text from the browser's edit window. When finished, paste the text back into the browser.

!!But I hate Vi!
If you don't like the modal behavior of Vim, fear not. Vim can be used as a non-modal editor using the *Evim* script. Evim leaves you in insert mode all the time. Or you could try "Cream":http://cream.sourceforge.net/, a much-enhanced implementation of Evim.

!!See Also
	* FlexWikiEmacsMode if you prefer editing with Emacs
	* FormattingRules for the syntax
	* FlexWikiTools for other non-browser tools

!!Todo
The Vim plugin is not complete. Some things yet to be done:
	* Test with "Cream":http://cream.sourceforge.net/
	* Omni-Completion for suggesting links to other pages
	* Ctrl-] tagging for links
